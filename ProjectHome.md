I love CrunchBang Linux - it is light, it is fast, it is ready to run in less than 10mns and it has got everyhing i need foe every day use.
The only problem is that this distro is based on Ubuntu Hardy and that i have major issues to run Xen on this platform.
Therefore, i decided to create a set of scripts to install a "CrunchBang-like" desktop on top of a "server-like" etch install.
